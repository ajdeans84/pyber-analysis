# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
In this analysis, we examined data from PyBer, a ride sharing app, and looked at trends across urban, suburban, and rural cities. Compiling the app data allowed us to calculate the total number of rides, total number of drivers, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fare for each of the three city types. 

## Results
//use images from the summary dataframe and line chart

//describe the differences in ride sharing data among different city types

For any given week, the total fares for urban cities is always greater than both suburban cities and rural cities, and the total fares for suburban cities is always greater than rural cities. That is, the lines on our chart never intersect, and each city type is consistent in terms of relative ranking for total fare. 

//include total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

## Summary
//provide three business recommendations addressing disparities among city types

Based on this analysis, I recommend that V. Isualize considers the following suggestions to address the disparities seen across city types.

1. In order to increase total fares from rural cities, PyBer can ...
